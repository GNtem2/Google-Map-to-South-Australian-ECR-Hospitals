Welcome to the simulated maps for emergency clot retrieval stroke
services provision in metropolitan Adelaide. These interactive maps
display the region serviced by a hospital under various service models
- i.e. number of hospitals - discussed in supplementary material of
the paper (see citation link above). Links at the top of this page
allow access to maps displaying different service models.

Please note that these maps were based on estimates of travel time
from random addresses to the major hospitals using Google Maps and
were not based on real ambulance transits.

Also note that the study was performed before relocation of the Royal
Adelaide Hospital to new premises.
